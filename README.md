# HubListen Technical Documentation:
## Tools and Technologies: 
    Framework: Visual Studio Code 
    Programming languages: Python, CSS, Javascript, HTML. 
    Technology: OpenAI API
## Methodology: 
We used a scrum method for this project because it allowed us to build the platform quicker for the hackathon.
## Architecture: 
Utilizing Visual Studio Code the Open AI key was imported. The next component was prompting the user to input the type of bot they would like to interact with, using a message input. The last component is a while loop that prompts the user to input their question and retain their response history. 
## Challenges and Bugs: 
The technical challenge was integrating the backend and the frontend to work seamlessly. We would need more time to troubleshoot this issue. 
## Testing: 
We tested each component separately. As we work we test after each update to the code so that bugs are fixed along the way. 
## Deployment: 
    Install: vite@latest
    Run: npm run dev
    Local:   http://localhost:5173/
